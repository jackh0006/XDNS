// mtu_cluster.go — Layer 2 of the adaptive per-group MTU strategy: cluster the
// valid resolvers into groups that share a similar viable MTU range, so a future
// Layer 3 can run each group at the largest MTU it can sustain instead of
// forcing the global minimum on everyone.
//
// Clustering is 1-D gap-based banding over each resolver's viable *download* MTU
// (the session-limiting, server-driven direction): the valid connections are
// sorted by download MTU and a new group is cut wherever the gap between two
// consecutive values exceeds gapRatio of the larger value. Each group's applied
// MTU is the minimum within the group, so every member can sustain it.
//
// This is intentionally read-only today: clusterConnectionsByMTU is a pure
// function and the result is logged/stored but does not yet drive routing.
