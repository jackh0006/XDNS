// resolver_pacer.go — intelligent, self-gating rate limiting per resolver. This
// is redistribution, NOT a global throttle: a resolver that signals overload
// (DNS RCODE != 0, i.e. REFUSED/SERVFAIL, or repeated timeouts) is put into a
// short, exponentially-growing cooldown window and deprioritized in selection,
// so its share shifts to resolvers with headroom. On sustained success the
// window shrinks back to zero (the resolver becomes fully un-paced again).
//
// Properties that make it safe ("can't hurt"):
//   - Self-gating: a healthy resolver has interval 0 and is never paced, so on a
//     clean network the pacer does nothing.
//   - Redistribute, don't idle: paced resolvers sink to the back of the candidate
//     list but are still used as a fallback when nothing else is available, so a
//     packet is never dropped or stalled just because resolvers are cooling down.
//   - AIMD: multiplicative backoff on overload, additive recovery on success —
//     it continuously probes for more headroom and never permanently caps anyone.
